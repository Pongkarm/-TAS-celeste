I made the code myself, it's not systematic. You can use the code as you want.
I'm not very good at it because I learned it myself. There aren't many tutorials on YouTube. I don't know any special techniques.
If you have any questions, please contact me at Darunpoppong@gmail.com
Thankyou I come from Thailand
